From the \emph{Re-print Doctor Fee Statement} screen, you can search for
previously generated doctor statements and select them for re-printing or
exporting to a csv file.

From the \emph{Doctor Fee Statement Search} section, you can specify the search
criteria by provider, statement number, or the statement date period. Click
on the \textbf{Search} button to look for all previously generated statements
that match your search criteria. The statements will appear in the
\emph{Doctor Fee Statement List} section.
If no matching statements were found, a `No records found!' message will appear.

To select or deselect all statements, the checkbox named \emph{Select/ deselect
all} found at the bottom left of the screen can be used for this purpose.

To select or deselect individual statements, the checkbox on the left of each
statement in the \emph{Doctor Fee Statement List} can be used.

When you have selected the statements that you want to re-print or export,
click on the \textbf{Print} or \textbf{Export} button at the bottom right of the
screen.

After clicking on the \textbf{Print} button, each statement will appear as a
popup window containing the pdf version of the statement.
The statement can be printed from that window.

If you are trying to export instead, a save file popup window will appear asking
for the name of the file as well as the location to export it.

The \emph{Re-print Doctor Fee Statement} screen can be closed by clicking on the
\textbf{Close} button at the bottom right of the screen.
