From the \emph{Re-generate Doctor Fee Statement} screen, you can search for
previously generated doctor statements and select them for re-generation.

From the \emph{Doctor Fee Statement Search} section, you can specify the search
criteria by provider, statement number, or the statement date period. Click
on the \textbf{Search} button to look for all previously generated statements
that match your search criteria. The statements will appear in the
\emph{Doctor Fee Statement List} section.
If no matching statements were found, a `No records found!' message will appear.

To select or deselect individual statements, the checkbox on the left of each
statement in the \emph{Doctor Fee Statement List} can be used.

You can also specify the format of the statement as `Simple' or `Detailed'
format from the dropdown box in the `Statement Format' column to the right
of the statement.

When you have selected the statements that you want to re-generate,
click on the \textbf{Re-generate} button at the bottom right of the
screen.

A popup window will appear to ask for confirmation on your action, click on the
\textbf{Yes} button to continue and re-generate the selected statements, or on
the \textbf{No} button to cancel.

Each statement will appear as a popup window containing the pdf version of
the statement. The statement can be printed from that window.

The \emph{Re-generate Doctor Fee Statement} screen can be closed by clicking on
the \textbf{Close} button at the bottom right of the screen.
