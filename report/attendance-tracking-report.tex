From the \emph{Attendance Tracking Report} screen, you can view and edit
attendances as well as export the attendances to a csv file that can be opened
in a spreadsheet program.

In the \emph{Attendance Search} section, you can filter down the search criteria
for the attendances to be displayed. At least one search criteria needs to be
input. Click on \textbf{Search} button to perform the search.

Attendances matching the search criteria will be displayed in the
\emph{Attendance List} section. If no matching attendances were found, a
message will appear with `No Records Found!'.

You can click on the \textbf{View} button on the left to view the attendance
in the attendance window in readonly mode.

If you wish to edit the attendance, click on the \textbf{Edit} button to open
the attendance window in edit mode. If the attendance has been billed,
a confirmation window will open to confirm that you wish to proceed with the
action.

For attendances with checked, or completed status, you can choose to change them
between either from the dropdown box in the `Attn Status' column.

For attendances marked as billed which has not yet been paid, you can mark
them as `Ready for Payment' from the dropdown box in the `Payment Status'
column.

You can also do bulk changes by clicking on the two buttons at the bottom of the
\emph{Attendance List}. You can change all completed attendances in the list
as checked, or all checked attendances as completed.

If you did any changes to the attendance status, you can save them by clicking
on the \textbf{Save} button at the bottom right.

You can export the attendances by selecting the level of details that you wish
from the dropdown box named `Data' and then by clicking on the \textbf{Export}
button.

There are also two special buttons on the main window at the top right named
\textbf{Outstanding Attn.} and \textbf{Unchecked Attn.} respectively. The
number in the red box represents the number of attendances with status either
outstanding or unchecked. When you hover your mouse cursor over the buttons,
a tooltip will appear that contains the date on which the count number is based
on.

When you click on the buttons, they will open the \emph{Attendance Tracking
Report} screen and automatically perform a search.
The visit date will be set to the date mentioned in the tooltip
and the attendance status set to either outstanding or unchecked depending
on which button you clicked on.

The \emph{Attendance Tracking Report} screen can be closed by clicking on the
\textbf{Close} button at the bottom right of the screen.
