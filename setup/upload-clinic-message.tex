From the \emph{Upload Clinic Message} screen, you can upload a PDF file for
display when the clinic frontline starts up.

You can select the date range from which the message will appear in the clinic
frontline. By default, it is set to start on the current date and end a week
later (7 days, including the date that it starts).

It is mandatory to input a description for the message for referral purposes
when managing existing clinic messages.

You can choose the PDF file to be uploaded by clicking on the \textbf{Browse}
button and selecting the file from the popup window.

Optionally, you can specify when the message will be removed via the `Remove
Message Date' field. If you do not specify it (by ticking the checkbox), the
message will stay in the system until you remove it manually.

When you are ready to upload, click on the \textbf{Upload} button.
A confirmation popup window will appear with the message `Uploaded successfully'
upon completion.

The \emph{Upload Clinic Message} screen can be closed by clicking on the
\textbf{Close} button at the bottom right of the screen. If there are any
unsaved modifications, a confirmation box will popup to confirm that you want
to close without saving. Click on the \textbf{Yes} button to close the screen
or on the \textbf{No} button to stay in the screen.
