Previously generated invoices can be re-generated to include updates made to the
included attendances or reversed to set the attendances inside it to `Ready to
bill' status.

The top section \emph{Invoice Search} is used to refine the search for invoices
that will be displayed in the \emph{Invoice List} section.
The search can be filtered by Company, Invoice number or Invoice period.
Click on the \textbf{Search} button to retrieve the invoices matching the search
criteria. If you do not input any search option, all invoices will be retrieved.

To select or deselect all invoices, the checkbox named
\emph{Select/ deselect all} found at the bottom left of the screen can be used
for this purpose.

To select or deselect individual invoices, the checkbox on the left of each
invoice in the \emph{Invoice List} can be used.

When you have selected the invoices that you want to re-generate or reverse,
click on the \textbf{Re-generate} or \textbf{Reverse} button respectively at the
bottom right of the screen.

If you clicked on the \textbf{Re-generate} button, a warning box will popup
asking for confirmation on the action. This warning will remind the user that
the invoice will be re-generated with the same set of attendances and pulling
updates made to these attendances.

Click on the \textbf{Yes} button to continue or \textbf{No} button to cancel
the re-generation of the invoice.

If you clicked on the \textbf{Reverse} button, a warning box will popup asking
for confirmation on the action. This warning will remind the user that reversing
this invoice will cause the included attendances status to be set to `Ready to
bill'. Furthermore, generating a new invoice will not necessarily contain the
same set of attendances as in the invoice currently being reversed.

Click on the \textbf{Yes} button to continue or \textbf{No} button to cancel
the reversal of the invoice.

The \emph{Re-generate / Reverse Invoice} screen can be closed by clicking on the
\textbf{Close} button at the bottom right of the screen.
